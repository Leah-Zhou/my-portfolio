    "content":"To achieve a responsive navigation bar and menu toggle, I used React Hooks to track the clicking events. Each click on the menu icon will switch the class for the navigation items, so that the class style could control menu items to expand or close."

    "title":"Connecting project profile to project page",
    "content":"My another challenge is making each project profile direct to the corresponded project page. I used the React router to achieve this goal. The route carries the project component. Each project profile acts as a link button and activates the corresponded routes via clicking. "

  "details":[
    "1. Each project is one component in the code with a similar structure. I should write the structure in a component with variables. Each project could import the component and inject its content to the variables. It could avoid repeating writing the same code.",
    "2. Project contents should be organized in their JSON files. It will be easier to edit and review. On this website, I only store the projects with more contents in the JSON files. I would work on restoring data into JSON files in the future."
